# Fate Rolls
Fate Rolls are a simple 6-sided dice (‚Äú1d6‚Äù) roll, from which the Storyteller determines the outcome directly.

Fate Rolls are used for purely-luck-based Challenges.  
Only use Fate Rolls if üß∞Skills could not non-trivially effect the outcome.

Fate Rolls can also have outcomes relative to the Fate Rolls of other Players. For example, all Players are asked to do a Fate Roll, and the lowest roll suffers some negative effect.
