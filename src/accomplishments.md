# Accomplishments
A Character should be awarded ðŸŒ Willpower when something happens which is all of:

- Significant
- Desirable for that Character
- Non-repetitive
- Visible to, or easily-discoverable by, that Character

The ðŸŒ Willpower awarded is at the Storytellerâ€™s discretion, but usually 2 to 6.

This bypasses the usual ðŸŒ Willpower limit of 10, instead limited to 20.
