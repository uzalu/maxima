# Exhaustion Challenges
The Storyteller may call an Exhaustion Challenge whenever they believe a Character is likely to fail it, due to having too much 💢Strain.

This is a normal Challenge with the following differences:

## Two-part
The Character's two highest 💢Strain ⚕️Status effects are used for one sub-Challenge each.

## Skill
The 🧰Skill(s) used must be relevant to the 💢Strain ⚕️Status.

For example:
- 'Toughness' to resist exhaustion from a physical injury.
- 'Discipline' to resist exhaustion from stress.

## Difficulty
The difficulty is equal to the relevant 💢Strain ⚕️Status effect's severity.

## Outcome
If the Challenge fails, the Character falls unconscious (or otherwise neutralised).
