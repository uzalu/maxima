# üéØ Challenges
If a Character wants to do something they might fail at, the Storyteller may start a Challenge.  
<span class="subline">This can happen by the Player‚Äôs choice, or initiated by the Storyteller if one outcome is clearly preferable, like noticing something.</span>

The Storyteller and any Players involved must understand what the Character(s) are trying to do.

The Challenge succeeds if the Success Rating is equal-to or greater-than the Difficulty.  
<span class="subline">The Storyteller determines the Difficulty.  
Sometimes there is a fixed Difficulty rating to compare to, sometimes it's more approximate.  
The Storyteller can choose to inform the Player(s) of the Difficulty.</span>

**Unless the Breakthrough effect has been applied, always limit the Success Rating to 10.**

## Skill
Choose a üß∞Skill which applies to this Challenge.  
<span class="subline">The Storyteller must agree that it applies.</span>

Use the üß∞Skill‚Äôs Rating as your Success Rating in this Challenge.  
<span class="subline">Use 0 if no üß∞Skill matches.</span>
### Weak Matching

If the üß∞Skill matches too weakly, the Storyteller may reduce its effective Rating in this Challenge.  
<span class="subline">This reduction is usually -1, -2, or -3.</span>
### Required Specialisation

If a üß∞Skill name is too broad, and more specialised knowledge is required, the Storyteller may choose to require one additional üß∞Skill which strictly matches the Challenge's requirements.

The additional üß∞Skill must be rated 3 or more.

Use the highest rating of the two üß∞Skills as the Success Rating in this Challenge.

For example, a Character may have 'Biology' as a üß∞Skill, but the Storyteller may determine that's not specific enough to cover something like performing neurosurgery. In this case, as long as the Character has 'Neurosurgery' at level 3 or above, they may use the highest-levelled üß∞Skill out of 'Biology' and 'Neurosurgery' for the Challenge.

## Boost (Optional)
The Player can choose to try their luck, which can improve the Challenge‚Äôs outcome.

Roll any number of 6-sided dice (‚Äú1d6‚Äù). Each roll costs 1 üå†Willpower.  
<span class="subline">You can use any applicable [random number generator](https://www.random.org/widgets/integers/iframe?title=Wizards+In+Space+Luck&buttontxt=Roll&width=160&height=230&border=off&bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&txtcolor=%23777777&altbgcolor=%23FF0060&alttxtcolor=%23000000&defaultmin=1&defaultmax=6&fixed=off), as long as the Storyteller can see the result.</span>

Rolls cost 2 üå†Willpower if the Character is [Impaired](/strain.md#impaired).

Choose one of the dice roll results, and apply the effect matching your result:
<span class="subline">If you choose to roll, you must use one of the roll results.</span>

| Result | Effect |
|-|-|
| 1 | [Blunder](#blunder). |
| 2 | -1 Success Rating. |
| 3 | No effect. |
| 4 | +1 Success Rating. |
| 5 | +2 Success Rating. |
| 6 | +3 Success Rating.<br>[Flourish](#flourish). |
### Blunder
If your Luck is 1, you Blunder, and fail the Challenge.

Roll another 1d6 to determine how badly you blundered. This is a Blunder Roll.

| **Result** | **Effect** |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Roll another Blunder roll.<br>Each Blunder Roll increases the severity of failure. |
| 2-5 | Failure with a side effect.<br>The side-effect is worse for lower results. |
| 6 | Simple Failure (no side effect). |
### Flourish
If your Luck is 6, a minor narrative benefit can be applied, if convenient.
