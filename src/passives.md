# Passives
Effects which activate automatically, rather than when explicitly called, require more memorisation and checks for Players and the Storyteller.

Hence the maximum number of Passive 💠Specials, chosen by the Player, is limited.

The Storyteller can choose to allow any number of 🛞Passives for their Players, but each one increases the potential weight of gameplay, due to higher memorisation requirements for everyone, especially the Storyteller.

The Storyteller is most impacted by this because most Passive 💠Specials are detrimental, and so Players are not naturally incentivised to remember them.

The memorisation requriements also scale with the number of Players. Larger parties means more to remember, and so to make sure effects trigger reliably, each Player in a larger party should have fewer 🛞Passives.
- 3 Players with 1 🛞Passive each = 3 to remember
- 5 Players with 3 🛞Passives each = 15 to remember

As a campaign progresses it will become easier to remember when effects trigger, because everyone gets used to them. The Storyteller may increase the number of 🛞Passives at any time.
<span class="subline">It is strongly advised that the Storyteller never **reduce** the number of 🛞Passives Players have.</span>
