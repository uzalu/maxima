# Professions
Characters can have a Profession ðŸ§°Skill, which covers all the basic areas of ability they would need to have the occupation they have.

This removes the need for a Player to go through all the boilerplate ðŸ§°Skills a Character would need, before adding anything interesting.

For example, if a Character is a Soldier, it's safe to assume they have at least an above-average understanding of weapons, above-average athletic ability, above-average tactical sense, etc.

Profession ðŸ§°Skills have fixed levels. It is recommended to set the level at 3, 4, or 5. It is recommended to either not use Profession ðŸ§°Skills at all, or give all Characters one Profession ðŸ§°Skill each at the same level as each other.

Profession ðŸ§°Skills, unlike other ðŸ§°Skills, are named after a job, role, occupation, etc., not after an area of knowledge or adaptation. Instead of 'Geology', a profession would be named 'Geologist'.
