# Characters
A Character is anything in the world which might undergo a [Challenge](challenges.md).

[Challenges](challenges.md) test the capabilities of a Character.

Almost anything can be a Character. Some examples include:

- Humanoids
- Vehicles; including Starships, Space Stations, etc.
- Cities or Armies; for example in an empire-strategy setting
- Pets

A lot of the language around Characters in this document applies primarily to Humanoids, but can be adapted to any type.

## Recording a Character
Any important Characters, especially Player-Characters, should be recorded.

The information can be recorded on paper, digitally, or however is convenient.  
<span class="subline">A campaign can be started with nothing recorded. Just record what's needed when it's needed.<span>

Recorded information is in these categories:

| Type | Simple Description | Initial Value |
|-|-|-|
| [🌱 Growth](growth.md) | Overall Power | 25 / 25 |
| [🌠 Willpower](willpower.md) | Free Energy | 10 |
| [💢 Strain](strain.md) | Unwanted Pressure | 0 |
| [🛞 Passives](passives.md) | Real-world Memorisation Requirements | 0 / 1 |
| [🧰 Skills](skills.md) | What a Character is good at |
| [💠 Specials](specials.md) | Notable non-standard abilities |
| [⚕️ Status](status.md) | Currently-active conditions |

## Character Creation
Characters, particularly Player-Characters, should be designed using this process.
