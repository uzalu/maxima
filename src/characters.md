# Characters
A Character is anything in the world which might be involved in a Challenge.

Challenges test the capabilities of a Character.

Almost anything can be a Character. Some examples include:

- Humanoids
- Vehicles; including Starships, Space Stations, etc.
- Cities or Armies; for example in an empire-strategy setting
- Pets

A lot of the language around Characters in this document applies primarily to Humanoids, but can be adapted to any type.

## Recording a Character
Any important Characters, especially Player-Characters, should be recorded.

The information can be recorded on paper, digitally, or however is convenient.
