# Skill Levels
ðŸ§°Skills have a number, their â€˜levelâ€™ or â€˜ratingâ€™, indicating how good the Character is at that ðŸ§°Skill.

## Level 0 : Neutral
The same as not having the ðŸ§°Skill.

The Storyteller should define 0 as roughly the lowest level of capability, excluding anomalies like disabilities, for the Character-type which is considered 'default' for the Campaign, usually humans.

To represent lower capability than 0 (disabilities, inferior species, etc.), use ðŸ’ Specials.

## Level 3 : Competent
This is considered â€˜Employableâ€™ where applicable.

## Level 10 : Top
The highest expected level for the campaignâ€™s main Characters.

The Storyteller determines how good 10 is, and should try to keep it consistent throughout a campaign.

It is possible to exceed 10 in Challenges, but very rare.

## Evaluation
  
In practice, these levels refer to the difficulty of actions at which a Character is guaranteed to succeed.  

For example, a ðŸ§°Skill at level 5 means a relevant Challenge with a difficulty of 5 wonâ€™t fail (unless Blundered).  
Therefore, it should be rare to have high-level Skills.
