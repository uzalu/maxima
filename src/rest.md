# Rest
A Rest is any time spent on non-stressful activities, during time-skips within Storyteller-defined downtime.

This can include recreation, socialising, sleep, etc.
<span class="subline">Players do not need to specify what their Character is doing narratively during Rest.</span>

## Rest Willpower Recovery
During Rest, Characters restore 🌠Willpower, but this restoration is limited.

Using Rest, Characters cannot restore their 🌠Willpower above 6.  
(Or 4 if the Character has any 💢Strain ⚕️Status effects)

Rest restores 1 🌠Willpower per 2 full hours.  
1 full hour of Rest can be rounded up to 1 🌠Willpower restored.
