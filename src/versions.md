| Part | Description |
|-|-|
| Namespace | The project line, in this case "Maxima" |
| Branch | Iterations like "2" or alternates like "B" |
| Major | A number which increments when a major change happens |
| Minor | A number which increments when a minor change happens |
| Status | Release Status, like "alpha", "beta", "public", "unstable", etc |
| Further Major.Minor.Status | Each new version can itself be in a non-complete state |

### Status
**Alpha** means that the features intended to be present for the "launch" version are not all implemented sufficiently to work representatively.

**Beta** follows Alpha, when the launch features are implemented, but are not sufficiently refined for launch.
