## Strain
*Note: this is being considered for removal.*

If the Character is not in a hazardous situation, subtract their current 💢Strain from the Success Rating of the Challenge.

### Adrenaline
If the Character is in a hazardous situation, 💢Strain is not subtracted from their Success Rating.

The Storyteller determines what counts as a hazardous situation.

The Storyteller can overrule this effect if the 💢Strain is too extreme or would specifically affect the Challenge.

### Adversity
Whenever 💢Strain is subtracted from the Success Rating of a Challenge, add 🔮Sync to the affected Character equal to the 💢Strain subtracted.

## Strain Stages
💢Strain can be at three different levels, as detailed below.

After a Character receives a 💢Strain-causing ⚕️Status effect, the Storyteller determines which of the following 💢Strain stages the Character is at.

The effect(s) of each 💢Strain stage apply cumulatively, so while at 'Stage 2: Impaired', the effect(s) of 'Stage 1: Strained' also applies.

### Stage 1: Strained
This is a level of strain which is distracting or causes discomfort.

- During Rest, instead of raising 🌠Willpower to 6, raise it to 4.

This state is active if any 💢Strain-causing ⚕️Status effects are present.

### Stage 2: Impaired
This is a level of strain which makes it noticeably more difficult to perform tasks in general.

- Using Boost in Challenges costs 2 🌠Willpower instead of 1.

### Stage 3: Doomed
This is a level of strain which will not get better on its own, and could cause loss of consciousness.

- Upon leaving any hazardous situation, and also upon any time-skip, run an Exhaustion Challenge. If the Character fails, they fall unconscious, and may even die.
